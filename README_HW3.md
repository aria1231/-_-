## HW3_110403030_RL
* Python Version
  * This notebook should be run in Python 3.8 or above.

* Required Libraries
  * Some of the common libraries for autoencoder tasks may include NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, Torch, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Pandas.

* Running Code on Google Colab
  * Data Preprocessing: The initial cells typically handle data loading and preprocessing. 
  * Model Training: After data preprocessing, define the autoencoder model and train it using libraries like Keras (via TensorFlow) or PyTorch.
  * Visualization: Use Plotly or Matplotlib to visualize the training progress, such as monitoring the loss curve over epochs.

* Colab link

* Other information
  * Due to my revised code still can't run successfully and I couldn't find the problem before the deadline, the colab link is my first version for this HW.
  * The first try didn't change too many parameters, and even I had a lot of ideas to change the reward rule, the other version can't run actually so please use this successful one to score. Thank you very much.
