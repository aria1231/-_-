## HW2_110403030_Autoencoder
* Python version
  * This notebook should be run in Python 3.8 or above.
    
* Required Libraries
  * Some of the common libraries for autoencoder tasks may include NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, Torch (if using PyTorch), Matplotlib, Plotly, and Pandas.
    
* Running code
  * on kaggle
  * Data Preprocessing: The initial cells typically handle data loading and preprocessing.
  * Model Training: Follow the cells defining the model structure and training process
  * Visualization: Use Plotly cells for interactive and static loss visualizations to monitor training progress over epochs.
